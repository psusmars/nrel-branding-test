# NREL-branding test app

A simple app intended for testing with the [NREL Branding Package](https://github.com/NREL/NREL-Branding-React-NPM-Package) using [yalc](https://github.com/wclr/yalc).

To start you'll want to download the branding repo and run `yarn build && yalc push` within that app.

Then on this side you'll want to make sure a `.yalc` folder exists, you may need to run `yalc add nrel-branding-react` in this repo.

Anytime you make changes to the branding repo you'll need to run the `yarn build && yalc push` commands.
